# Frontend Learning Journey

This repository is created to document my personal journey in learning frontend development.  
Here I record what I study, what I practice, and what I discover while exploring the fundamentals and modern tools of the frontend world.

## What You Will Find Here

- **Study notes** on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frontend frameworks.
- **Practice code and small projects** that help me strengthen core concepts.
- **Experiment folders** where I try out new ideas or unfamiliar technologies.
- **Problem logs** documenting issues I encountered and how I solved them.
- **Progress updates** as I continue learning and improving my skills.

## Purpose

This repository serves as both a learning archive and a way to track my growth over time.  
It helps me organize knowledge, review past work, and stay motivated to keep going.

## Future Goals

- Build more structured projects as my skills improve.
- Explore modern frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte.
- Learn best practices in UI/UX, performance optimization, and code organization.
